## About Me:
Junior Developer | Instructional Specialist | Mathematics Instructor

TOVTC here, full stack junior developer, instructional specialist, and mathematics instructor. My original field of study was mental health, and I've worked in the mental health, non-profit, and healthcare sectors throughout and since my undergraduate degree, working everything from social work to primary care clinics to addictions research to medical laboratory. I've also been a mathematics instructor since 2014. I initially got into coding during my final semester at university when I took a neuroeconomics course (think neuroscience of decision making) that required statistical analysis using R - and that was pretty fun.


After graduating University of Toronto's School of Continuing Studies Coding Bootcamp in 2022, I became a TA for their web development program and a junior developer at i3 Solutions Inc in healthcare technologies shortly after - something of a dream job, considering my prior work and educational backgrounds.

* 😝 Pronouns: She/Her/她
* 🇭🇰  Bilingual: English, Cantonese (廣東話)
* 💻 Current coding projects: healthcare technologies with i3, web development with EdX x UofT
* 🎓 Prior educational background: Honours BSc with distinction in mental health from the University of Toronto under their co-op program
* 🏢 Prior work background: primarily in the mental health, non-profit, and healthcare sectors
* ❓ Ask me about: overly convoluted hypotheticals
* 🌵 Self development: maintaining a consistent 6x a week gym schedule, keeping all my non-cacti houseplants alive, and improving my Chinese reading and writing skills
* 💥 Fun fact from my youth: I have an Industry Canada aeronautical radio license and was a trained RCAC ceremonial drill instructor on the rifle drill team until I retired from the program in 2014 at the rank of Warrant Officer 2nd Class
* 🌻 Relevant fun fact: I like sunflowers, nerd stuff, and punk music (but I'll pretty much listen to anything - from 1950's jazz to Cantonese nu-metal)


Outside of coding, teaching, and healthcare, I also have a passion for narrative and English literature and was nominated for University of Toronto's English Department Essay Prize by my professor in 2019. The essay in question was a think-piece on the interrogation of real-world accessibility in Fraction and Aja's Hawkeye (2012) (but I'm also into other nerd stuff, not just comics).
